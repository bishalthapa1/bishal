        <h1>Experience</h1>
        <p>Hello, My Name is Bishal Thapa and I am here to  express my experience of learning web development like coding designing developing.<br>
            I had recently joined NAMI College after knowing that it offers the Bsc(Hons).computing under the patnership with University Of Northhampton.The tutor here on Nami were too friendly.Our module lecturer Mr.Ankit Thapa sir (CSY1018) taught us about the basic of HTML,CSS . Also, he has taught us gitub and its uses as codes pushed on github can store for long period of time so we can use as per the need of the codes. As now we are capable of developing basic website. 
            
        </p>
        <h2>Our Refliective Discussion</h2>
        <p>Refliective Discussion basically promotes students to express and think about their declaration on what they have learned.In my case During term one i found learning web development have been the best expreience ever. As this module teaches us and encourage us to make different type of webside where we use  code from which we can make different type of website through code we can make different kind of design, layout and also can add animation on it which is very fun and a great expreience. As the website must be responsive to all devices which helps to make the user friendly to the user.As i have lerned to detect the bugs and debug it which helps website to make more effective. I found web development course more helpful to develop skills</p>
        <h3>Site Development</h3>
        <p>I have frequently changed the layout design of the website to  make it look  more attractive but i failed several times but at last i give one layout out of several layouts</p>
